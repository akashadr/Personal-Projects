# 🖥️Personal-Projects💻
## Introduction:
Hello folks👋, hope you all are doing well. Are you looking to contribute in an open-sourced project? Are you here for the same intention? Then, You're most welcome! We're here to contribute to this repository and to make this repository a good resource of personal tech projects, so that, people can visit to this repository and gain project ideas about what kind of projects they can make to make their own unique project, as coping projects wouldn't be beneficial.
## Rules:
1. Any kind of tech projects are acceptable, but clearly define the project in the `README.md` file.
2. It's not necessary that you have to create a whole project and then only you can upload. You can continuously send your PRs to build various parts of your project.
3. Please don't send PRs to spam or don't spam anyways.
4. Respect everyone here and everyone will respect you.
